The year 2017 was a time of hype and speculation for cryptocurrencies. The proliferation of new blockchains, and the volatility of their coin prices had water-coolers all over the world abuzz with passionate discussions and debates over whose crypto-portfolio would grow fastest. But those discussing only the store-of-value, transactional, and otherwise monetary applications of blockchain technology are missing the big picture. The real game changer that blockchain brings to the table has nothing to do with the creation of a new generic monetary unit.

What follows is not a technical discussion of blockchain technology, how Dapps work, or how to build one. Instead I'm focussing on why Dapps present a new, disruptive business model that I think will thrive in 2018. For an explanation of the technical theory underpinning Dapps, see the links under "Further Reading" at the end of this article. Now, let's get started!

A seismic opportunity
---------------------

Blockchain technology and the rise of Decentralized Applications (Dapps, pronounced "Dee-apps") has enabled a new model to disrupt platform businesses in many industries through disintermediation. Those who act quickly to build Dapps that obsolete the platform incumbents, stand to gain significantly through monetization mechanisms known in the Blockchain space as Initial Coin Offerings, Pre-mined allocations, or Founder's Rewards. The nature of Dapps is that those which succeed will form a new kind of impenetrable monopoly in their respective industries, so time is of the essence for those seeking to profit from the coming seismic shift from Platforms to Dapps.

The bigger they are, the harder they fall
-----------------------------------------

The current holy grail business model is the Platform. Platforms create value by facilitating exchanges between producers and consumers. Cashing in on their status as an authoritarian intermediary, platforms are able to profit in a variety of ways: by charging "rent" to producers, by charging transaction fees to producers and/or consumers, or by selling the by-products of the network's usage: user attention (advertisement), and user data (contact info, usage patterns, demographics, psychographics, interests, etc). Platforms are protected by network effects, which make it difficult for challengers to attract an audience and thrive. Sixty percent of Unicorns (startup businesses valued at over a billion dollars) today are platforms.

The rise of monetized open protocols
------------------------------------

Dapps offer an appealing alternative to centralized platforms. Leveraging the decentralization made possible by Blockchain technology, Dapps can provide the same value that Platform businesses create for producers and consumers, but without the authoritarian intermediary. The value-creating work is delegated to an open peer-to-peer network of participants (sometimes called miners, stakers, forgers, etc) rather than executed by a centralized platform controlled by a single entity.

Dapps are monetized through a mechanism called "Appcoins". Appcoins are a type of utility token, because they are required as a "ticket" to use the functionality of the Dapp. In a decentralized Ad Network, advertisers might pay the network's Appcoin to publishers whose content drives clicks or impressions of their ad. In a decentralized ride sharing service, passengers might pay the network's Appcoin to compensate their driver for a ride. Prices of these goods and services are usually set by the open market of the network's producers and consumers.

Appcoins are scarce. Usually there is a fixed limit on the total number that will ever be issued. This scarcity is what allows the Appcoin to rise in value as the popularity and usage of the Dapp rises. Since the supply of Appcoins are fixed, more users raises the demand for the Appcoin, and therefore its Exchange value increases. Unlike the supply of the Appcoin, the supply of the goods/services offered in the Dapp network is not fixed. This means that the price of these goods/services can rise/fall relative to the value of the Appcoin, as market forces dictate.

This property of a token that rises in value as network adoption increases allows an Appcoin to also act as a kind of equity asset, which provides economic incentives to founders, contributors, miners, and even users for their participation in the network.

Dapps present a new way to cut through the network effects enjoyed by platforms. Because there is no authoritarian intermediary, producers and consumers may find Dapp alternatives to platforms attractive because of lower costs (no platform taking profit), and better trustworthiness (no platform to manipulate or misuse data). Furthermore, Appcoins can provide economic incentives for early adoption by both producers and consumers, effectively paying speculative producers and consumers to abandon platform incumbents, and adopt Dapp challengers. This is why there is an enormous opportunity for those who act quickly to build the Dapps that will obsolete the platform incumbents.

Acting Quickly
--------------

Recognizing that the opportunity at hand is immense, those seeking to take advantage of the coming shift in value creation from walled-garden platforms to open Dapps must act quickly. Luckily, they can follow the model of those that preceded them. What follows are SOME of the activities required to launch a quality ICO.

1\. Pick a market to operate in, consider the following when choosing:

-   Is there a platform incumbent that has demonstrated the viability of the domain, and a viable model for capturing value in the domain?
-   Is centralization or the requirement of trust in a central party seen as a negative in the domain?
-   Does value change hands directly from producers to consumers, or are their third parties such as advertisers?
-   Are the products/services exchanged commoditized or differentiated?
-   Are the products or services valued consistently or variable?
-   Do you have relevant expertise in the domain?
-   Is it possible to represent the domain as a protocol, representing the nouns and verbs of the domain as transactions, with shared rules enforceable by a decentralized network of untrustworthy actors?

2\. Design a decentralized replacement for the platform incumbent

-   What are the roles of network participants?
-   What are the transactions they engage in?
-   What proofs will be offered that valuable work has been done?
-   What is the consensus mechanism to achieve a trusted decentralized ledger?
-   How will participants be incentivised?
-   How will you provide for the safety and security of network participants

3\. Approach early advisors for feedback on Dapp vision

-   Technical
-   Business
-   Legal

4\. Create a detailed whitepaper. It should cover:

-   Intentions and goals of the Dapp
-   Plans for token distribution
-   Mechanism for establishing consensus
-   Structure of the non-profit that oversees the Dapp
-   Management of developer bounties

5\. Technical description of the Dapp

-   Seek community and advisor feedback
-   Legal advice on Initial Coin Offering and Non-profit structure
-   Technical advice on Whitepaper details
-   Business advice on Initial Coin Offering structure

6\. Build alpha Dapp

7\. Announce and promote the Initial Coin Offering

-   Community engagement
-   Professional Website
-   Blog and Social posts
-   Graphics and Videos
-   Advertisement: Paid Search and Display Ads

8\. Launch Initial Coin Offering

9\. Build production Dapp

10\. Launch and market Dapp to the public

How to get paid in a world without companies
--------------------------------------------

Founders and stewards of a Dapp won't actually own equity in a company, or stand to gain directly from the transactions of network participants. So, it is reasonable to ask how they will be rewarded for their investment of time, labor, and capital. There are three possible mechanisms, that are common in the Dapp space:

-   Initial Coin Offering (ICO) - Token buyers purchase the Appcoin, providing initial liquid funds for the team to launch the Dapp
-   Pre-mined Allocations - The team holds back some of the Appcoin, providing long-term stake
-   Founders Reward - The Dapp protocol spawns Appcoins to fund ongoing maintenance and development of the Dapp

All three of these mechanisms rely on the issuance of a utility token or Appcoin. Because the Appcoin are not centrally controlled once they are issued, they can be freely exchanged by third parties. This allows them to attain monetary value through market forces such as supply/demand, and speculative trading.

A Natural Evolution
-------------------

Platforms have served a valuable role of facilitating direct exchange between producers and consumers. They overthrew the gatekeepers of yesteryear by offering a better deal to their constituents, becoming the new gatekeepers, and profiting from this status.

Dapps are the natural result of taking this evolution to its logical conclusion. They will overthrow the platforms, and this time there will be no gatekeepers. Those hoping to profit from the coming redistribution of wealth will need to build or invest in Dapps that provide viable decentralized systems solving real problems more efficiently that their platform counterparts.
