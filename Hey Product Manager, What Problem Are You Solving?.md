# Hey Product Manager, what problem are you solving?
In a previous post, “Hey Product Manager, take a page out of Picasso’s sketchbook”, I suggested that Product Managers could learn from the way that Pablo Picasso captured the essence of the bull form in his lithograph series “The Bull”.

The TLDR of that post was that you should first clarify your problem statement, and then define progressively simpler solutions to that clear problem statement. By taking this approach, you can keep your product features focussed on clear problems, and make more deliberate choices about how you iterate.

For this post, let's focus on what tool I use to help me develop a clear problem statement. 5 Whys analysis is a good way to go from a vague concept to specific and clear problem statements. I’m going to walk you through an example of how I apply it.

Let’s imagine that you wanted to build a dating app. You know that it is a multi billion dollar industry, and growing. So, you’ve imagined a slew of me-too features: profiles, swiping, chatting, a freemium model, the whole nine yards. You’ve imagined that your branding and a more human touch will set you apart from the competition which is known for bad support and aggressive account banning practices. You’re pitching it to your fellow product buddy for some feedback.

“Stop. What are your why's?” She says.

After a moment of annoyance, you decide to play along, and use 5 Whys Analysis to clarify to the root problem you are trying to solve. You start by asking yourself, “why am I building this?” It takes a few minutes but you come up with the following:

Starting Problem: Daters want connection, but they have trouble finding it, despite dozens of apps designed to do just that.

“Why?”, she asks.

“‘Connections’ in apps rarely turn into the real thing, in the real world.”

“Why is that?”

“Users chat endlessly in-app, and never agree to meet for a date.”

“Why is that?”

“They don’t feel safe, and they are chatting to try to confirm, or overcome that fear.”

“Why?”

“Stories of people being catfished (or worse) have them guarded.”

“Why?”

“They don’t really know who the other person is or if they can be trusted.”

“Ok. You’ve done your 5 whys, so what are the core problems you need to solve for Daters?”

You think about that for a few minutes, and then jot down..

Actual Dates: Get users on actual dates, rather than endlessly swiping and chatting.

Safety: Give users confidence in their safety, so nothing stops them from going on actual dates.

You’ve spent 5-10 minutes, and you’ve gone from a me-too feature list to a much deeper understanding of the assumed problems your customers need solved. The key word there is assumed. Your next step, of course, will be to validate that these are actually real customer problems, but you’ve got a much better starting point for prototyping or building an offer to test.

Validating your market problems is worthy of a lengthy separate post. Perhaps I’ll write about that someday. But for this series, next up is an example of BEAF analysis in action with our Dating App example.
