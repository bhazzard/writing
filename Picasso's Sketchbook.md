# Hey Product Manager, take a page out of Picasso’s sketchbook

In Picasso’s lithograph series “The Bull”, the artist painted the form of a bull over and over again, each time getting more refined, doing more with less. Beginning with a complex ink and brush sketch, over the course of eleven sketches, Picasso ultimately captures the essence of the animal as concisely as possible with a mere outline.

Picasso clearly understood the essence of the bull form. Then simplified to only those strokes that were necessary to achieve that essence. If you are a creator, consider taking a page out of Picasso’s sketchbook.

As a Product Manager, I am a creator of Products. In my work I’ve observed over and over again how easy it is to end up with a feature list a mile long. Each and every feature is complex and many of them will take months to build. How can we train our brains to bias towards simplicity, when human nature is inherently biased towards perfectionism?

I’ll tell you how I do it. First, I clarify my problem statement. Then, I simplify the solution. Why? Because you cannot create a simple solution to a problem you don’t thoroughly understand.

To do this, I use two complementary conceptual frameworks: 5 Whys Analysis, and something I call BEAF Analysis.

To clarify my problem statement, I use 5 Whys Analysis. Most people are familiar with 5 Whys, which is usually applied to root cause analysis, and involves asking “why?” five times, to approximate the ultimate cause of an issue. In my work, I also apply it to understanding the essence of the problem I’m trying to solve.

To simplify my solution, I use BEAF Analysis. BEAF is my own invention, and works on a similar premise as 5 Whys. You just ask yourself “how might we make this simpler?” multiple times until you have defined Basic, Enhanced, Advanced, and Future (hence “BEAF”) versions of solutions to your problem statement. It works because our brains don’t usually default towards only what is essential. So you must iteratively brainstorm towards simplicity.

Pablo Picasso’s Bull series is a masterclass in distilling a complex subject to its very essence. To simplify a solution, you must first understand clearly the essence of the problem you are solving. This is what makes 5 Why’s and BEAF analysis work so well together. I’d love to know what Picasso’s thought process was when he was creating the Bull series, but I know these tools are a helpful way to train my brain towards simplicity and iteration when developing products.
